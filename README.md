# Neural Networks from Zero

Welcome to my first AI project! If you're here to explore how neural networks work, you're in the right place. In this walkthrough, you'll gain a deeper understanding of fundamental algorithms and theories in the Machine Learning using an simple example as follow...

## Simple Multilayer Neural Network

To elucidate concepts and theories, I've developed a neural network from the ground up. In other words, it's an artificial neural network functioning without relying on libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras. Instead, I've employed libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to construct this network. This hands-on approach will give you insight into the core principles behind neural networks.
